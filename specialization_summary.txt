AGENT SPECIALIZATION ANALYSIS SUMMARY
=====================================
Generated: 2025-06-30 10:07:51

OVERVIEW:
---------
This analysis measures how "specialized" agents are to specific properties.
Higher specialization = agents work primarily at one or few properties.
Lower specialization = agents work across many different properties.

KEY METRICS EXPLAINED:
---------------------
• Specialization Score (0-100): Composite metric where 100 = highly specialized to one property
• Property Concentration (HHI): 0-1 scale, higher = more concentrated at fewer properties  
• Most Frequent Property %: Percentage of tours at agent's most common property
• Unique Properties Served: Number of different properties agent works at

SYSTEM-WIDE IMPACT:
------------------
Average Specialization Change: -24.6 points
Median Specialization Change:  -17.5 points

Agents Becoming MORE Specialized:  4 agents
Agents Becoming LESS Specialized:  22 agents

Property Coverage Changes:
• Single-Agent Properties: +0 change
• Highly Concentrated Properties: +0 change

INTERPRETATION:
--------------
✅ DECREASED SPECIALIZATION: Optimization tends to distribute agents across more properties.
   This increases system flexibility but may reduce property-specific expertise.
